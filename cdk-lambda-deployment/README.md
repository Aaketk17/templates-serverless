# Welcome to your CDK JavaScript project

You should explore the contents of this project. It demonstrates a CDK app with an instance of a stack (`CdkLambdaDeploymentStack`)
which contains an Amazon SQS queue that is subscribed to an Amazon SNS topic.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app. The build step is not required when using JavaScript.

## Useful commands

* `cdk synth`            emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
* `cdk bootstrap`        create a stack that includes resources(required only if it is the first time you want to deploy with the CDK)
* `cdk deploy`           deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`             compare deployed stack with current state
